  - message: The public health professionals in developing countries, however, who are often in the best position to exploit information and mapping technologies have in many cases been the last to receive the technology. This has mainly been due to lack of funding, lack of access to simple technology and lack of awareness of the opportunities that these technologies provide.

  - message: Spatial epidemiology and earth observation data could also inform operational decision making at a more local level, for example to help officials target efforts at a local/regional level. To be usable for local decision-making, data needs to be presented in a way that is relevant to and understandable by local decision makers.

	<p>The afrimapr project will create software building blocks in R and learning resources to facilitate the use of spatial data in health and other applications in Africa. The project will promote these resources in Africa and beyond to initiate a community of users and developers to maintain and improve them. </p>

	<p>The R building blocks will make it easier to perform spatial data management tasks that should be straightforward but seldom are, including: summarising data by administrative regions of different levels; joining and displaying data referenced by administrative region names; access to environmental, socio-economic and health data, such as WorldPop, the Malaria Atlas Project and OpenStreetMap; and displaying data in static maps and interactive web applications. Components will be designed for ease of use to target new users of R. Focusing on Africa is a choice taken to promote usability. </p>
